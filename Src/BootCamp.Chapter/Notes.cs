         * 
         *  Struct - 
         *      
         *      Use a struct over a class If it isn't a service, it is 3 or less fields, and once initialized it won't change
         *      
         *      Value Objects - Something that refers to a single or multiple simple primitive values
         *      some good examples where structs could be used are for phone numbers, a tightly related group of data
         *      that makes up an object, that is small and simple.
         *      
         *      values must be assigned when it is initialized.
         *      
         *      Can have a method, but they should be simple and self reliant
         *      
         *      struct PhoneNumber
         *      {
         *          public readonly string Number;
         *          public readonly string AreaCode;
         *          public readonly string Country;
         *          
         *          public PhoneNumber (string number, string areaCode, string country)
         *          {
         *              Number =  number;
         *              AreaCode = areaCode;
         *              Country = country;
         *          }
         *      {
         *      
         *      
         *  ref, in, out
         *  
         *  Ref - allowes even value types to be passed by reference.
